# One Episode Full (Wolfenstein 3D)
Custom Wolfenstein 3D EXE so that you can only play the first episode, but use the full assets<br>
This is useful to modders who want to use the full Wolf3D assets but only release a changed first episode<br>
Without this you'd have two options:<br>
Block off the first level of other episodes so they couldn't be completed/played, or pretty much give people the whole game (thats piracy lol)<br>
<br>
<br>
Or, you could just use my EXE ;)


<h1>Installation</h1>
1) Clone the repo (copy and paste 'git clone https://github.com/relic374/one-episode-full-wolf3d/')<br>
2) Copy the file 'WOLF3D.EXE' in the folder named "WOLF3DEXE"<br>
3) Paste/Replace the 'WOLF3D.EXE' in your mod's directory with the one you copied<br><br>
And thats that!
<br>
Thanks for messing around with this!<br>
